Clojure Data Cookbook
===============

The goal of this cookbook is to give you some concrete examples for getting started with data wrangling and exploration in Clojure. These are examples with real-world data, and all the bugs and weirdness that entails.

This repo is a copy of [pandas-cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook), but implemented in Clojure instead of Python.

I created it as a demonstration of Clojure's awesome data wrangling abilities, and the flexibility of Clojure's core data structures.

[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library for doing
data analysis. It's arguably a killer-app for data science in Python, and is known for it's ease of use and terseness.
