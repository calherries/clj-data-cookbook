[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library for doing
data analysis. It's arguably a killer-app for data science in Python, and is known for it's ease of use and terseness.

This repo is a copy of a pandas tutorial, but in Clojure. I created it to showcase the power of using plain clojure data structures for data science.
